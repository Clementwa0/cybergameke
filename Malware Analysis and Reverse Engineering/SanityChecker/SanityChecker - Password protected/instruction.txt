SanityChecker - Password protected
Points: 1
EN: It appears that the bash script left another executable on your system. It also seems to be password-protected. I don't know the password, but I'm really curious about what secrets this file holds. The flag is in the format SK-CERT{...}. There are multiple ways to obtain the flag. For example, you can use static analysis of the binary to either read the flag from its data or find a hardcoded password. Alternatively, you can use dynamic analysis or binary patching.
