SanityChecker - Sleepy python
Points: 1
EN: I found some Python code on my computer, but I don't know what it's doing. I tried to run it, but it doesn't seem to do anything. Flag is in format SK-CERT{...} and is hidden in command that is executed using os.system(...). This scenario is for environment with BASH.
