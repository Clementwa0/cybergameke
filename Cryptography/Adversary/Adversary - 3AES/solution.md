Certainly, Clement! Let me walk you through how to **properly decrypt a 3AES-encrypted message** using **CyberChef**, in a step-by-step and *clearer way*, especially with the important note that **no padding should be used**.

---

## 🔐 Understanding the Decryption Flow

For **3AES**, the encryption is done as:

> `E(K3, D(K2, E(K1, P)))`

So the **decryption** is the reverse:

> `D(K1, E(K2, D(K3, C)))`

Where:

* `E()` is **AES Encrypt**
* `D()` is **AES Decrypt**
* `K1`, `K2`, `K3` are **secret keys**
* `C` is the ciphertext (Base64 encoded)

So, your **CyberChef recipe** should **apply these operations in reverse**.

## 🔧 What You Need

Three keys (all Base64-encoded), so first decode them (in CyberChef):

### 🗝️ Key 1:

```
h+NvKyaJFRhpn7lRWo0JGGcSk7TOd2ltibSSI1CGDCk=
```

### 🗝️ Key 2:

```
CznIYU0rBgmzSb7WyqYfj+WKyDSXbbnsa8Wp/IRvUOc=
```

### 🗝️ Key 3:

```
ihpLsXPURUTwH4ULO9/87rHRCQibQO6+V4/QKJL7Bgg=
```

---

## 🧪 Example Ciphertext

Here’s a sample Base64-encrypted message:

```
rOkz0hogqrrjVXe8KhfwPmTXqy0NI5BaaVRwg8g4490Gi//XIIYY6t7pMpw/0DN4V26tcdwmmOOne75oEt4/oQ==
```

## ✅ Steps in CyberChef

1. **Open CyberChef:**
   [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

---

2. **Paste the Base64-encoded ciphertext** into the input window.

---

3. **Build the Recipe with These Steps (in this exact order):**

### 🔹 Step 1: From Base64

* Converts ciphertext to binary (raw bytes).

---

### 🔹 Step 2: AES Decrypt

> **This is `D(K3, C)`**

* **Mode:** ECB
* **Key:** Use key3 
* **Padding:** **None** ← important!
  (Uncheck the "Auto padding" option or set it explicitly to "None")

---

### 🔹 Step 3: AES Encrypt

> **This is `E(K2, result)`**

* **Mode:** CBC
* **Key:** key2 (decoded)

---

### 🔹 Step 4: AES Decrypt

> **This is `D(K1, result)`**

* **Mode:** ECB
* **Key:** key1 (decoded)
* **Padding:** **None**
