## üß† Challenge Description

> You know that feeling‚Äîwaking up after a wild night of gambling, pockets full of keys you‚Äôre sure are yours, but somehow every single one feels wrong?  
>
> Now imagine being a novice cryptographer after that same night. You‚Äôve got the keys‚Äîsure‚Äîbut absolutely no clue what they open, how they work, or why you even have them in the first place. Welcome to the hangover of cryptography.

We‚Äôre given an encrypted file suspected to use **AES encryption in ECB mode**, and a known 128-bit key in hex format. Our goal is to decrypt the file and recover the flag.


## ‚úÖ Decryption Steps Using CyberChef

### 1. üîì Load the Encrypted File
- Open [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).
- Upload the encrypted file ecb.dat



### 2. üîê Configure AES Decryption
- Add the operation: `AES Decrypt`
- Set the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Value                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Mode           | ECB                                     |
| Key            | `00000000000000000000000000000000`      |
| Key format     | Hex                                     |
| IV             |                      |
| Input type     | Raw                                     |

### 3. üì§ View the Output
- If correctly decrypted, you‚Äôll see output in the format:


Flag: `SK-CERT{f1r57_15_3cb}`
